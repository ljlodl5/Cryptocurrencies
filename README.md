# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 

The purpose of this exercise was to utilize measures of unsupervised machine learning in order to draw clustered behavioral patterns for assessing whether to enter the cryptocurrency market. 
Via different scaling models and methods, there is an ideal state of clustering (visually represented via an elbow curve) where the ability to observe patterns/clusters is clear. 
Too many disparate clusters/data points will render the ability to assess patterns difficult.
